Simple Linear Regression: House Price Prediction

Objective:
This project demonstrates a Simple Linear Regression model built with Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on the area (in square feet). It includes code for training the model, predicting prices, and visualizing the regression line.

Key Features:
 --Trains a linear regression model on sample data.
 --Predicts house price for a given area.
 --Generates a scatter plot with the regression line using matplotlib.

Files Included:
Simple Linear Regression.ipynb: Python script with the full implementation

Screenshots of the code and output plot for reference

Example Output:
Prediction- The model predicts the price for a house of 180 sqft as ~3500.

Plot: Shows data points and the fitted regression line.
